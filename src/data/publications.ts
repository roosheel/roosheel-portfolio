    title: 'An mRNA-based broad-spectrum antiviral inspired by ISG15 deficiency protects against viral infections in vitro and in vivo',
    journal: 'Science Translational Medicine',
    year: 2025,
    doi: '10.1126/scitranslmed.adx5758',
    pmid: '40802739',
    impact: 'This work demonstrates that a minimal set of 10 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), delivered via mRNA, can provide broad-spectrum protection against diverse viral pathogens including influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and Zika virus—mimicking the natural antiviral state found in ISG15-deficient individuals. This discovery enables development of a "universal" prophylactic antiviral that could be rapidly deployed during emerging viral outbreaks to protect high-risk populations (healthcare workers, immunocompromised patients, nursing home residents) regardless of the specific virus, eliminating the need to wait for virus-specific vaccines or therapeutics and providing a crucial first-line defense against future pandemics.',

    title: 'Monoallelic expression can govern penetrance of inborn errors of immunity',
    journal: 'Nature',
    year: 2025,
    doi: '10.1038/s41586-024-08346-4',
    pmid: '39743591',
    impact: 'This research reveals that autosomal random monoallelic expression (aRMAE)—where immune cells randomly express only one copy of certain genes—explains why individuals carrying the same disease-causing mutation can have drastically different clinical outcomes, from severe illness to complete health. This finding fundamentally changes genetic counseling and clinical decision-making by demonstrating that penetrance of autosomal dominant immune disorders depends not just on having a pathogenic variant, but on which allele (mutant vs. normal) is preferentially expressed in immune cells, allowing clinicians to better predict disease risk, tailor monitoring strategies, and avoid unnecessary interventions for mutation carriers who may never develop symptoms.',

The findings enable genetic diagnosis of patients with this constellation of symptoms and provide a rational therapeutic approach using existing JAK inhibitors like baricitinib, which showed clinical improvement in treated patients.',

    year: 2023,
    doi: '10.1016/j.molcel.2023.10.036',
    pmid: '37995687',
    impact: 'This work reveals that nuclear RNA degradation machinery (the exosome and Integrator) functions as a critical quality-control mechanism that prevents endogenous retrovirus activation and maintains cell identity by selectively degrading nascent transcripts in open chromatin regions. The discovery that disrupting RNA catabolism causes preferential loss of long gene expression (gene-length asymmetry) provides a mechanistic explanation for why exosome mutations cause neurodegenerative diseases and suggests new therapeutic targets for conditions involving aberrant cell dedifferentiation or ERV reactivation, while offering researchers a chemical approach to generate totipotent-like cells for regenerative medicine applications.',

    doi: '10.1038/s41586-023-05736-y',
    pmid: '36813963',
    impact: 'This study identifies the mechanistic triad underlying autoimmunity in Down syndrome—persistent elevation of inflammatory cytokines (particularly IL-6), chronic CD4 T cell hyperactivation via STAT3 signaling, and expansion of autoreactive CD11c+ B cells that produce organ-specific autoantibodies. These findings enable precision medicine approaches using targeted IL-6 or JAK inhibitors as preventive therapy for high-risk DS individuals before autoimmune disease onset, support risk stratification based on cytokine profiles, and justify comprehensive multi-organ screening protocols for thyroid, pancreatic, and gastrointestinal autoimmune conditions rather than reactive testing alone.',

    impact: 'This work establishes a validated single-cell RNA sequencing methodology (scCoVseq) that unambiguously distinguishes SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic mRNAs from genomic RNA, overcoming previous technical limitations that classified most viral reads as "ambiguous" and excluded them from analysis. This advance enables researchers to precisely track viral gene expression dynamics at single-cell resolution across different cell types and infection stages, facilitating better characterization of viral variants, identification of infected versus bystander cells in heterogeneous samples, and more accurate assessment of host-virus interactions to inform antiviral drug development and vaccine strategies.',

By providing a standardized, reproducible alternative to donor-dependent primary cells with extended passage capacity (up to 40 passages), this work enables more ambitious genetic engineering experiments in cystic fibrosis, COPD, and viral pathogenesis research that would be impractical with limited primary cell resources.',

These findings enable development of genetic risk stratification tools to identify vulnerable individuals requiring earlier intervention and inform rational therapeutic strategies that enhance innate antiviral immunity through the OAS1/RNaseL pathway rather than targeting the rapidly-evolving viral proteins directly.',

    pmid: '35333911',
    impact: 'This work demonstrates the counterintuitive finding that ISG15 deficiency, rather than increasing viral susceptibility, actually enhances resistance to HIV-1 infection through persistently elevated interferon-stimulated gene expression. These findings challenge conventional understanding of antiviral immunity and could inform novel HIV-1 prevention or treatment strategies by mimicking the protective immune state seen in ISG15-deficient individuals, potentially through therapeutic modulation of ISG expression without requiring ISG15 itself.',

    doi: '10.1128/JVI.01257-21',
    pmid: '34523966',
    impact: 'This study reveals that SARS-CoV-2 uniquely co-opts the NF-κB inflammatory pathway for its own replication while simultaneously suppressing interferon responses, explaining both the virus\'s unusual replication requirements and the excessive cytokine production characteristic of severe COVID-19. By demonstrating that NF-κB inhibitors can simultaneously block viral replication and reduce inflammatory responses in vitro, this work establishes a therapeutic rationale for targeting NF-κB signaling in COVID-19 treatment, though the pathway\'s essential cellular functions necessitate careful drug development to achieve antiviral effects without compromising normal immunity and cell survival.',

    impact: 'This study reveals that humans can survive without TBK1 (unlike mice where it\'s embryonically lethal) but develop severe autoinflammatory disease driven by excessive TNF-induced cell death rather than impaired antiviral immunity. The discovery that anti-TNF therapy successfully treats TBK1-deficient patients provides immediate clinical benefit for this rare condition and fundamentally advances our understanding of how TBK1 regulates inflammatory versus antiviral pathways in humans, informing treatment decisions for autoinflammatory diseases.',
